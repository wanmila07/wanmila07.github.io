## Problem

Informal SME incentive programmes in developing economies typically operate on first-come-first-served or single-objective prioritisation. Policymakers face an impossible choice:

- **Efficiency** — allocate to high-growth, high-revenue firms
- **Equity** — prioritise vulnerable micro-enterprises and female-owned businesses
- **Sustainability** — favour technology-ready, ESG-aligned firms

No current framework handles all three simultaneously under real budget constraints across thousands of heterogeneous businesses.

## Approach

Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) with adaptive operators to generate Pareto-optimal allocation sets — giving policymakers a structured view of real trade-offs rather than forcing a single answer.

**Key components:**
- Constrained MOEA with adaptive crossover and mutation operators
- Three-objective scoring framework (Efficiency, Equity, Sustainability)
- Interactive Pareto trade-off explorer
- Policy scenario simulation
